# Electric SQL Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Electric SQL sync for Astrolabe Task Manager, based on the Electric Schema Sync design document.

## Implementation Approach

We took a **simplified approach** leveraging the built-in capabilities of the `@electric-sql/pglite-sync` plugin rather than building custom synchronization logic. This decision was based on discovering that the SDK already provides most of the required features.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Use SDK Built-in Features**: The Electric SQL TypeScript SDK provides automatic migration handling, retry logic, persistent sync state, and transactional consistency out of the box.

2. **Simple Configuration**: Minimal configuration required - just the Electric URL and list of tables to sync.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues to work in local-only mode if Electric SQL is unavailable.

4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for Electric sync objects while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Implementation Details

### Core Files

1. **`database/index.ts`** - Database factory functions
   - `createDatabase()` - Main factory with optional sync
   - `createLocalDatabase()` - Explicit local-only database
   - `createSyncedDatabase()` - Explicit synced database
   - Automatic PROJECT_ROOT task creation
   - Electric sync initialization with multi-table support

2. **`database/store.ts`** - Database operations interface
   - Clean Store interface for database operations
   - ElectricStore extends Store with sync management
   - Business methods for tasks and context slices
   - Works transparently with or without sync

3. **`database/ELECTRIC_SQL_SETUP.md`** - Setup documentation
   - Quick start guide
   - API reference
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Architecture overview

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Client Bootstrap Logic** - Automatic migration handling via SDK
✅ **Multi-table Sync** - Transactional consistency for all tables
✅ **Retry Logic** - Built-in exponential backoff via SDK
✅ **Offline Support** - Works offline, syncs when connected
✅ **Status Monitoring** - Through shape subscriptions
✅ **Graceful Degradation** - Falls back to local-only mode
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support

### Configuration

```typescript
// Simple configuration
const store = await createDatabase({
  enableSync: true,
  electricUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  syncTables: ['tasks', 'context_slices', 'task_dependencies']
});

// Or use environment variables
ELECTRIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Testing

- All database tests pass without Electric SQL running
- Tests verify both sync and local-only modes
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Type-safe test assertions

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Minimal code to maintain
2. **Reliability**: Leverages battle-tested SDK features
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify
4. **Performance**: Optimized by Electric SQL team
5. **Future-proof**: Updates come from SDK upgrades

## What We Didn't Build

By using the SDK's built-in features, we avoided building:
- Custom migration tracking
- Manual retry logic
- Seed database management
- Complex sync monitoring
- Error recovery mechanisms

All these features are handled automatically by `@electric-sql/pglite-sync`.

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Configure Electric SQL server for production
2. **Monitoring**: Add application-level sync status monitoring
3. **Testing**: Add integration tests with real Electric SQL server
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with sync setup instructions
