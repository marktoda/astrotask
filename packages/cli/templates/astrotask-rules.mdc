- **Astrotask Overview:**
  - Local-first, MCP-compatible task management platform for human + AI collaboration
  - Hierarchical task management with parent-child relationships
  - Context-aware task bundling for better decision-making

- **Essential MCP Functions:**
  ```typescript
  // Get next available task to work on
  getNextTask(options?: { parentTaskId?: string, priority?: string, status?: string })

  // Create tasks with hierarchy and dependencies  
  addTasks({ tasks: [{ title, description?, parentIndex?, dependsOn?, priority?, status? }] })

  // Add context information to tasks
  addTaskContext({ taskId, title, description, contextType? })

  // Update task status (pending, in-progress, done, cancelled, archived)
  updateStatus({ taskId, status, cascade? })

  // List tasks with filtering
  listTasks({ statuses?, parentId?, includeProjectRoot? })

  // Add dependencies between tasks
  addDependency({ dependentTaskId, dependencyTaskId })
  ```

- **Agent Workflow Patterns:**
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Start work session pattern
  const nextTask = await getNextTask({ priority: "high", status: "pending" });
  await updateStatus({ taskId: nextTask.id, status: "in-progress" });

  // ✅ DO: Break down large tasks
  await addTasks({
    tasks: [
      { title: "Research approach", parentIndex: 0 },
      { title: "Implement core logic", parentIndex: 0, dependsOn: [1] },
      { title: "Add tests", parentIndex: 0, dependsOn: [2] }
    ]
  });
  ```  // ✅ DO: Add context as you work
  await addTaskContext({
    taskId: currentTask.id,
    title: "Implementation Notes",
    description: "Found issue with X, resolved by Y approach",
    contextType: "implementation"
  });
  ```

- **Task Management Best Practices:**
  - **Always update task status** when starting/completing work
  - **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, manageable subtasks
  - **Add context** for decisions, blockers, and implementation notes
  - **Use dependencies** to model workflow order and blockers
  - **Reference existing tasks** when creating related work

- **Status Management:**
  - `pending` - Not started, available for work
  - `in-progress` - Currently being worked on
  - `done` - Completed successfully
  - `cancelled` - Abandoned or no longer needed
  - `archived` - Completed and archived for reference

- **Priority Levels:**
  - `high` - Urgent work, critical path items
  - `medium` - Normal priority work (default)
  - `low` - Nice-to-have, background tasks

- **Context Types:**
  - `implementation` - Technical details and code notes
  - `research` - Investigation findings and links
  - `complexity` - Risk assessment and complexity notes
  - `requirements` - Clarifications and acceptance criteria
  - `testing` - Test strategies and coverage notes
  - `general` - Miscellaneous notes and observations
  - `acceptance` - Acceptance criteria that must be met for task completion

- **❌ DON'T:**
  - Don't forget to update task status when starting work
  - Don't create tasks without clear titles and descriptions
  - Don't skip adding context for important decisions
  - Don't create deeply nested hierarchies (max 3-4 levels)
  - Don't leave tasks in `in-progress` status indefinitely

- **Integration Patterns:**
  - Use task IDs in commit messages: `git commit -m "feat: implement X (TASK-123)"`
  - Reference tasks in PR descriptions and code comments
  - Add links to external resources in task context
  - Track progress by updating status as work progresses

- **Acceptance Criteria Best Practices:**
  - Add acceptance criteria when creating tasks that need clear completion conditions
  - Use `contextType: "acceptance"` for all acceptance criteria entries
  - Write criteria as testable statements (e.g., "API returns 200 status")
  - Include specific validation steps in the description
  - Check all acceptance criteria before marking tasks as `done`
  
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Add clear acceptance criteria
  await addTaskContext({
    taskId: currentTask.id,
    title: "API endpoint handles errors gracefully",
    description: "Returns 400 for invalid input, 404 for missing resources, with descriptive error messages",
    contextType: "acceptance"
  });
  
  // ✅ DO: Make criteria measurable
  await addTaskContext({
    taskId: currentTask.id,
    title: "Page loads within 3 seconds",
    description: "Initial page load completes in <3s on 3G connection. Measured with Lighthouse.",
    contextType: "acceptance"
  });
  ```
