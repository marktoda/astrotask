# Testing Editor Fix for CLI Dashboard

## Issue
When spawning an external editor from the CLI dashboard, the editor doesn't receive all key presses and skips/doesn't run smoothly.

**Update**: After the initial fixes, the dashboard UI was not properly restored after closing the editor (everything highlighted, inputs not working, and sometimes still capturing input during editor session).

## Root Cause
1. **Initial issue**: The blessed terminal UI library was still capturing keyboard input while the external editor was running
2. **Restoration issue**: The terminal state and blessed screen weren't being properly restored after the editor closed
3. **Fundamental issue**: Trying to manage complex terminal state transitions while keeping blessed "alive" was too fragile

## Final Solution
Complete refactor using a cleaner approach:
1. **Destroy blessed screen completely** before launching editor
2. **Use synchronous execution** (`execFileSync`) to run the editor
3. **Recreate blessed screen** after editor exits
4. **Dashboard reinitializes** all components with fresh state

This approach completely avoids the complexity of trying to pause/resume blessed's terminal handling.

## Technical Details
- Uses `execFileSync` from Node.js to run editor synchronously
- Blessed screen is destroyed with `screen.destroy()` before editor launches
- Terminal is reset to normal state with escape sequences
- After editor exits, a custom event triggers dashboard recreation
- All UI components are recreated with fresh blessed screen instance

## Test Steps
1. Build the CLI: `cd packages/cli && npm run build`
2. Run the dashboard: `npm run dashboard`
3. Navigate to a task in the tree view
4. Press 'e' to add a sibling task with editor or 'E' for child task
5. Verify that:
   - The terminal cleanly switches to the editor
   - All keystrokes are received by the editor
   - No characters are skipped or delayed
   - The editor runs exactly as if launched normally
   - After closing the editor (save or cancel), verify:
     - The dashboard is completely recreated
     - All UI elements work correctly
     - No visual artifacts or highlighting issues
     - Navigation and key bindings work properly
     - Task tree state is preserved
6. Try different editors by setting EDITOR environment variable:
   - `EDITOR=nano npm run dashboard`
   - `EDITOR=vim npm run dashboard`
   - `EDITOR=code npm run dashboard` (for VS Code)
   - `EDITOR=nvim npm run dashboard` (for Neovim)

## Expected Results
- Clean transition from dashboard to editor
- Editor works exactly as expected with no input issues
- Clean transition back to dashboard after editor closes
- Dashboard is fully functional after editor session
- No terminal state corruption or visual artifacts

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Simplicity**: No complex terminal state management
2. **Reliability**: Editor gets complete control of terminal
3. **Compatibility**: Works with any editor that runs in terminal
4. **Clean State**: Fresh blessed instance eliminates state corruption issues
