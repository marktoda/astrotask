# Dashboard Performance Improvements

## Issue
The CLI dashboard was freezing/becoming unresponsive when making updates (e.g., changing task status), particularly noticeable when pressing the space key to cycle through task states.

## Root Cause
The CRUD operations (updateTask, updateTaskStatus, addTask, etc.) were using a problematic async pattern:
- They wrapped async operations in `(async () => { ... })()` 
- This caused immediate return without waiting for database operations to complete
- Each operation immediately triggered `flushChangesImmediate()` and `reloadFromDatabase()`
- These heavy database operations blocked the UI thread

## Solution
Implemented optimistic updates with deferred auto-save:

### 1. Removed Immediate Async Wrappers
- Converted CRUD operations to synchronous functions
- Removed `(async () => { ... })()` pattern that was causing race conditions

### 2. Implemented Optimistic Updates
- UI updates happen immediately when user makes changes
- Changes are tracked in memory using TrackingTaskTree
- No immediate database flush after each operation

### 3. Enabled Auto-Save with Short Interval
- Auto-flush enabled by default with 2-second interval
- Only flushes when there are pending changes and not already flushing
- Prevents concurrent flush operations

### 4. Improved UI Feedback
- Status bar shows "💾 Saving..." during flush operations
- Shows "● Unsaved (auto-save active)" when changes are pending
- Shows "✓ Saved" when all changes are persisted

### 5. Simplified Keyboard Handlers
- Removed try-catch blocks and async handling from space key handler
- Store subscriptions handle UI updates automatically

## Benefits
- Immediate UI response to user actions
- No freezing or blocking during updates
- Changes are automatically saved in the background
- Better visual feedback about save status
- More robust error handling

## Technical Details
The key changes were made to:
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/store/index.ts` - Store actions
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/ui/components/task-tree.ts` - Keyboard handlers
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/ui/components/status-bar.ts` - Status display

The pattern now follows:
1. User action → Immediate UI update
2. Mark as having unsaved changes
3. Auto-save triggers after 2 seconds
4. Background flush to database
5. UI shows save status throughout
