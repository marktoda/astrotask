# Dashboard Performance Improvements

## Issue
The CLI dashboard was freezing/becoming unresponsive when making updates, particularly:
1. When changing task status (space key)
2. When creating new tasks (a/A keys)
3. When editing tasks (e key)

**Update**: There was also an issue where newly created tasks were not being saved to the database.

## Root Cause
The CRUD operations were using problematic async patterns:
- They wrapped async operations in `(async () => { ... })()` 
- This caused immediate return without waiting for database operations to complete
- Each operation immediately triggered `flushChangesImmediate()` and `reloadFromDatabase()`
- These heavy database operations blocked the UI thread
- For new tasks, the system needed to get real database IDs, making the freeze more noticeable
- **Additional Issue**: The conditional reload after task creation was not always triggering, leaving tasks with temporary IDs that weren't persisted

## Solution
Implemented optimistic updates with deferred auto-save:

### 1. Removed Immediate Async Wrappers
- Converted CRUD operations to synchronous functions
- Removed `(async () => { ... })()` pattern that was causing race conditions

### 2. Implemented Optimistic Updates
- UI updates happen immediately when user makes changes
- Changes are tracked in memory using TrackingTaskTree
- No immediate database flush after each operation (except for new tasks)

### 3. Enabled Auto-Save with Short Interval
- Auto-flush enabled by default with 2-second interval
- Only flushes when there are pending changes and not already flushing
- Prevents concurrent flush operations

### 4. Improved UI Feedback
- Status bar shows "üíæ Saving..." during flush operations
- Shows "‚óè Unsaved (auto-save active)" when changes are pending
- Shows "‚úì Saved" when all changes are persisted
- Task creation shows progressive status: "Creating task..." ‚Üí "Saving task..." ‚Üí "Finalizing task..." ‚Üí "Task created successfully"

### 5. Simplified Keyboard Handlers
- Removed try-catch blocks and async handling from space key handler
- Store subscriptions handle UI updates automatically

### 6. Optimized Task Creation Flow
- New tasks show immediately with temporary IDs
- Background flush to get real database IDs
- **Fixed**: Always reload after task creation to ensure temporary IDs are replaced with real database IDs
- Automatic ID mapping from temporary to permanent IDs
- Smart reload that preserves selection and UI state

### 7. Fixed Task Persistence Issue
- Removed conditional reload logic that was sometimes skipping the database reload
- Task creation now always performs a full reload to ensure data persistence
- Added better error handling and status reporting throughout the creation process

## Benefits
- Immediate UI response to user actions
- No freezing or blocking during updates
- Changes are automatically saved in the background
- Better visual feedback about save status
- More robust error handling
- Smoother task creation experience
- **Guaranteed task persistence** - all newly created tasks are properly saved to the database

## Debugging
If you experience issues with task creation:
1. Run `./debug-task-creation.sh` to check current task state
2. Watch the status bar during task creation for the full progression:
   - "Creating task..." ‚Üí "Saving task..." ‚Üí "Finalizing task..." ‚Üí "Task created successfully"
3. If any step fails, an error message should appear in the status bar
4. Check that the "Finalizing task..." step completes - this is when temporary IDs are replaced with real ones

## Technical Details
The key changes were made to:
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/store/index.ts` - Store actions
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/ui/components/task-tree.ts` - Keyboard handlers
- `packages/cli/source/dashboard/ui/components/status-bar.ts` - Status display

The pattern now follows:
1. User action ‚Üí Immediate UI update
2. Mark as having unsaved changes
3. Auto-save triggers after 2 seconds (for most operations)
4. Background flush to database
5. UI shows save status throughout

For new task creation:
1. Create task with temporary ID
2. Show in UI immediately
3. Flush to get real ID
4. **Always reload** to ensure database consistency
5. Map temporary ID to permanent ID 
6. Update UI with final state
