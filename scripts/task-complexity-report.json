      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Initialize Project Repository and Core Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository initialization task into subtasks covering: 1) Basic project setup with npm/yarn and TypeScript configuration, 2) Installation and verification of core dependencies, 3) Project structure creation with proper directories, 4) Initial build configuration and verification tests",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward setup task with well-defined steps. The complexity is low-to-moderate as it involves standard project initialization procedures with specific dependencies. The main challenges are ensuring proper TypeScript configuration and verifying all dependencies work together correctly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Define Core Zod Schemas and Domain Models",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the schema implementation into subtasks for: 1) Base schema utilities and common types, 2) Task schema with validation rules, 3) Epic schema implementation, 4) Project and ContextSlice schemas, 5) Type inference exports and validation utilities",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple related schemas with validation rules and TypeScript type inference. The moderate complexity comes from ensuring proper relationships between schemas, implementing validation rules, and setting up error handling. Each schema deserves its own subtask for clarity."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Setup SQLite Database with ElectricSQL Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database setup into: 1) SQLite initialization with SQLCipher encryption, 2) Database schema design and implementation, 3) ElectricSQL client integration, 4) Migration system implementation, 5) Connection pooling and transaction utilities, 6) Performance optimization with WAL mode",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the combination of SQLite configuration, encryption requirements, ElectricSQL integration, and performance considerations. The database design must align with the Zod schemas while supporting CRDT synchronization. Migration systems and connection management add additional complexity layers."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core CRUD Operations and Data Access Layer",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data access layer implementation into: 1) Base repository pattern interface, 2) Task repository implementation, 3) Epic repository implementation, 4) Project repository implementation, 5) Query builders with type safety, 6) Transaction support and optimistic locking, 7) Pagination and filtering utilities",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing multiple repository classes with complex operations including pagination, filtering, and transaction support. The type safety requirements and optimistic locking for concurrent updates increase complexity. Each entity type deserves its own implementation subtask."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build MCP Server with Core Function Catalogue",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MCP server implementation into: 1) Server setup with JSON-RPC over HTTP/WebSocket, 2) listTasks function with filtering and pagination, 3) createTask and updateTask functions, 4) deleteTask and completeTask functions, 5) getTaskContext function with ancestry retrieval, 6) Error handling and validation framework, 7) Function discovery manifest, 8) Integration tests with mock clients",
      "reasoning": "This is a highly complex task involving server implementation with multiple API functions, each requiring validation, error handling, and specific business logic. The MCP protocol implementation adds another layer of complexity, as does the context retrieval functionality which requires traversing task relationships."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop CLI Interface with Core Commands",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the CLI development into: 1) Command framework setup with help text, 2) Task management commands (list, add, update, remove, complete), 3) Context retrieval commands, 4) Database operation commands, 5) User experience enhancements (colors, prompts, configuration)",
      "reasoning": "The CLI implementation has moderate complexity due to the variety of commands, argument parsing, and interactive features. Each command group requires specific validation and formatting. The user experience elements like colored output and interactive prompts add additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Context Resolver with Embeddings Support",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the context resolver implementation into: 1) Vector storage selection and setup, 2) Embedding generation pipeline, 3) Context bundling for task ancestry and related data, 4) Similarity search implementation, 5) Caching layer for performance optimization, 6) Context digest generation, 7) Performance testing and optimization",
      "reasoning": "This task has very high complexity due to the technical challenges of vector embeddings, similarity search, and context aggregation. The performance requirements (400ms target) add significant complexity, as does the need to integrate with various data sources for context bundling. The caching layer and optimization needs further increase complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Add PRD Import/Export and Graph Rendering Features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the PRD and graph features into: 1) Markdown parser for PRD documents, 2) Epic/Task generation from parsed PRD, 3) PRD export functionality, 4) Dependency graph analysis, 5) Mermaid diagram generation, 6) Task relationship inference from content",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex parsing and generation logic for both PRD documents and graph visualizations. The relationship inference from content analysis is particularly challenging. Converting between different formats (markdown, task objects, Mermaid) adds significant complexity, as does maintaining consistency in round-trip conversions."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate ElectricSQL Sync with Postgres Backend",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the sync implementation into: 1) Postgres backend setup with ElectricSQL, 2) CRDT conflict resolution strategies, 3) Sync queue management for offline operations, 4) Connection state management and retry logic, 5) Rich-field conflict detection, 6) JWT authentication integration, 7) Sync status reporting, 8) Network failure simulation and recovery testing",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task in the project, involving distributed systems challenges with offline-first synchronization, conflict resolution, and authentication. The CRDT merge logic and rich-field conflict detection are particularly complex. Network failure handling and recovery scenarios add significant complexity to both implementation and testing."

      "taskTitle": "Build Linear Integration and VS Code Extension",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration work into: 1) Linear API adapter for issue synchronization, 2) Linear sync push/pull commands, 3) VS Code extension skeleton with activation events, 4) Task list and context view UI components, 5) Extension commands for task operations, 6) Real-time sync indicators and conflict UI, 7) Extension settings and configuration",
      "reasoning": "This task combines two complex integrations - Linear API and VS Code extension development. The two-way synchronization with Linear requires careful conflict handling. The VS Code extension involves UI development, command registration, and real-time updates. The combination of these elements with the existing sync infrastructure results in high complexity."
